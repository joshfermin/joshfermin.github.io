# Online Blog / Resume
My personal website to display my current projects and work experience. The toolstack I used was mainly jekyll where I played around with the css, embedded ruby, and yml files. It is currently being hosted using github pages [here](http://joshfermin.github.io). I took many elements from the Clean blog theme (as credited to below) and made it my own.
