# My Website
<p>My personal website to display my current projects and work experience. The toolstack I used was mainly jekyll where I played around with the css, embedded ruby, and yml files. It is currently being hosted using github pages. I took many elements from the Clean blog theme (as credited to below) and made it my own.</p>

It is currently being hosted here: [joshfermin.me](http://joshfermin.github.io)
