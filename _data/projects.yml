    Project for Software Methods Engineering and Tools course, Spring 2014. 
    A web application that will be deployed to heroku to help computer science
    students at CU Boulder schedule their upcoming courses. Note: The app deployed 
    on heroku may not be the same as the source code seen here (i.e. it was not 
    pushed recently to heroku).

    Designed a lock-activated power-strip using an Arduino unit and an RF system. Through the efforts 
    of our team we were able to code, design, and implement this system from scratch successfully. 
    We later presented this system at the Engineering Design Expo at the University of Colorado 
    Boulder.
