<h2 class="section-heading">Fun with the laser cutter</h2>
<p>So for our semester project we are creating a 8x8 grid that will be reactive to touch such that when a user touches a cell in the grid it will light up and make a sound. For this to be possible we will need to section off each LED that we will use for our lattice and essentially make a cardboard grid. So for this project what I did was sketch up a quick SVG file that would cut out on foam core the baffles for the lattice (couldn't find any free cardboard, so we used this instead). </p>


<p> Here is what I came up with made in adobe illustrator: </p>

<p> After I created this, I exported it to svg and then imported it into corel draw. In corel draw I removed the fill and then made sure the lines were of width "hairline". After that I just copy pasted 9 of each of these and then cut them out on foam core. I will put up some pictures later when I have time to show the end result, but that was pretty much all there was to it!</p>
