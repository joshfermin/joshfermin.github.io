<h2 class="section-heading">Physical Computing Activity</h2>

<p>For our first design activity, we had to create a device that would help a paralyzed (from the neck down) patient be able to use the speakerphone and be able to see the screen. The catch was, we had to create it using materials we had on hand...</p>

<p> So I just started folding the paper from my syllabus and eventually with enough folding and enough tape I was able to fashion my syllabus into some sort of pouch. I then added a necklace of beads I got from my friend and finally through trial and error we were finally able to make the necklace phone holder you see below: </p>
