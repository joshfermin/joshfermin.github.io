<h2 class="section-heading">Intro to Prototyping</h2>
<p>For this class we were introduced to foam core prototyping. One of th emost memorable things that stuck out for me in this class is the story of the palm pilot corporation. This wsa where they held pieces of wood that would be shaped as the same size as the upcoming palm pilot to see how it would feel just to carry it around. I think they did this for either a week or a month, but it was interesting to see that prototyping can actually be very useful just to have a feel of your final product and do some initial testing and research before you go ahead and created something.</p>

<p>For this particular class, we were supposed to prototype a new ebook reader. So my partner and I brainstormed some ideas and eventually we ended up with this: </p>

<p>What we were going for was an e-reader that was more shaped like a book instead of a single page, this would make it feel more familiar and maybe even more accepted.</p>
