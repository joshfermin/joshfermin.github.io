<h2 class="section-heading">Laser Cutting and 3d Printing</h2>
<p>Just a quick update on ITLL training...</p>

<p>As I went through the training for laser cutting and 3d printing, I was immediately drawn to what I could use these tools for in my project. The laser cutter would make it super easy to make multiple parts quickly and I immediately thought of using that for our cardboard grid lattice. As for the 3d printer I wasn't sure how that could be implemented, since the price point for the ITLL is super high, but it was interesting to learn about how precise it can print and how you could print whatever you modeled in TinkerCAD or OpenSCAD, or any modeling software really.</p>
