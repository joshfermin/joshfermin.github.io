<h2 class="section-heading">Josh Here!</h2>

<p>Welcome to my first blog post! A little bit about me... I am currently studying computer science at the University of Colorado, Boulder with an emphasis on software engineering. So far I have done a lot of software based projects, but this semester I am going to attempt to dive into more physical computing. I have a couple ideas on what I want to do this semester and I'll keep you updated through this blog! </p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
